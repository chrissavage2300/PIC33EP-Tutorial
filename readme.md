THese are just a collection of self paced tutorials for myself on how to use the PIC33EP series.

Project 1: Blink an LED using Timer 1

Project 2: Turn on an LED with a switch. 

Project 3: Take an ADC Reading and turn on/off an LED

Project 4: PWM an LED

Project 5: Vary the PWM based on a pot

Project 6: Output the ADC reading Via UART
