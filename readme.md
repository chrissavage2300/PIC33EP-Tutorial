<h1>PIC33EP Tutorials.</H1>

These are a bunch of tutorials I came up with to help me learn XC16. The eventual end goal is to use the encoder module. These tutorials use the dsPIC33EP32MC202. It should work for other families.

Project 1: Blink an LED using Timer 1

Project 1a: Test some math functions and see how quick the micro is.

Project 2: Turn on an LED with a switch. 

Project 3: Take an ADC Reading and turn on/off an LED

Project 4: PWM an LED using output compare.

Project 5: Vary the PWM based on a pot

Project 6: Output the ADC reading Via UART

Project 7: Talk to another micro Using SPI. Take ADC reading and output it via SPI to another micro which will display it via UART

Project 8: Encoder Module. Read Encoder Module and output it via UART

Project 9: TBD

Project 10: Motion Controller project.


<h2>Common Settings.</H2>
Clock:
Note: Make sure that IOL1WAY is set to allow multiple reconfigurations.
